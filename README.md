# Bitcoin 2 ‚Äî Post-Quantum Digital Currency

![Bitcoin 2 Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example/bitcoin2-prototype/main/docs/architecture-diagram.png)

---

## üìå Introduction

Bitcoin 2 is a post-quantum secure cryptocurrency built from the ground up using Rust and Python. It is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional blockchains like Bitcoin by providing:

- Quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives
- Fair mining accessible to any device (PC, mobile)
- A lightweight and scalable decentralized architecture

---

## üéØ Purpose and Vision

The original Bitcoin opened the door to decentralized digital currency. However, it is not built to withstand quantum computing, and mining has become centralized and energy-intensive.

**Bitcoin 2** aims to:
- Provide a fair mining opportunity for everyone
- Ensure security in the post-quantum era using Dilithium signatures
- Enable scalable and fast transactions through efficient consensus and networking

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Bitcoin 2 architecture is modular:
